## About The Project

This project consists of two main components: a **Discord Quiz Bot** and a **Quiz Management Application**. The goal is to create an interactive quiz experience for users on Discord while providing a web-based interface for admins to manage quizzes and questions.

### Discord Quiz Bot   [Bot demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GUkRYxtZMVVFOnZTVKVyWq_4ZhoE7koT/view?usp=sharing)

The **Discord Quiz Bot** enables users to participate in quizzes directly within Discord servers. Key features include:

- **Quiz Selection**: The bot displays a list of all available quizzes  sets for users to choose from. Each quiz consists of multiple-choice questions.
- **Timed Questions**: Once a quiz is selected, the bot presents each question one by one, with a set timer (e.g., 30 seconds per question). The bot tracks how much time users take to answer each question.
- **Leaderboard**: After the quiz, the bot displays a leaderboard ranking players based on their performance. The leaderboard is sorted by:
  - **Points**: Users earn points based on the number of correct answers.
  - **Time**: If multiple users have the same number of correct answers, their ranking is decided by the time taken to answer the questions (faster users rank higher).
  - The leaderboard shows the top 10 players, as well as each user's rank, even if they are not in the top 10.

## Commands

Here are some commands you can use:

- **!hello**: Say hello to the bot!
- **!goodbye**: Say goodbye!
- **!sets**: Show the current available quiz sets.
- **!set "set_number"**: Choose the set you want to attend. For example: `!set 1`
- **!leaderboard "set_number"**: Check the leaderboard for a specific set. For example: `!leaderboard 1`

### Quiz Management Application

The **Quiz Management Application** is a web-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing quiz sets and individual questions. Features include:

- **Quiz Set Management**: Admins can create, update, and delete quiz sets (e.g., each set contains 10 questions).
- **Real-Time Sync**: The quiz management app is connected to the same database used by the Discord Quiz Bot, ensuring that any changes made in the admin panel are instantly reflected in the quizzes displayed to users during gameplay.

### AI-Generated Quiz Questions

To enhance quiz content creation, this project integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically the **Gemini API** via the Gemini SDK. Admins or question setters can specify the **topic** and the **number of questions** required for a quiz. The process works as follows:

1. **User Input**: Admins fill out a form, specifying the topic (e.g., "Science"), and the number of questions (e.g., "10 questions").
2. **API Request**: The application sends these parameters (topic and question count) to the **Gemini API** through the SDK.
3. **API Response**: The Gemini API generates a set of quiz questions based on the provided parameters and returns the questions in **JSON-formatted text** (not a JSON file). The response is structured as text, making it easier to parse and store directly in the database.
4. **Storage**: The generated quiz questions are parsed, formatted, and stored in the database in real-time, ensuring they are available for use in the Discord Quiz Bot and for display in the quiz management panel.

This integration significantly streamlines quiz creation, ensuring a diverse variety of quiz questions that can be generated dynamically without manual input from admins. The Gemini APIâ€™s flexibility allows for easy adjustments based on topic and question count, making quiz creation both efficient and customizable.

## Websockets

### Why Websockets?

In web development, **WebSockets** are crucial for enabling **real-time, two-way communication** between the client and the server over a single, persistent connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, where each request/response cycle is separate and stateless, WebSockets maintain an open connection that allows data to flow continuously in both directions. This makes it ideal for applications that require live updates, such as **real-time chat**, **live notifications**, or, in this case, **interactive quizzes**.

### Importance of Websockets in This Project

When building a real-time quiz system like this one, the use of **WebSockets** is especially important for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: If we were to use the traditional **HTTP request-response cycle** for each question in the quiz, we would need to initiate a new request every time a user answers a question. This would create unnecessary overhead for both the client and server, resulting in **increased latency** and **higher server load**. Every question would trigger a separate HTTP request, which can quickly become inefficient.

2. **Reduced Server Overhead**: Instead of following the traditional HTTP request/response cycle, we can load all questions at once and maintain a **live connection** with the client. This reduces the need for repeated HTTP requests and responses. The server only needs to send updates as necessary, without reprocessing each question individually.

3. **Security Best Practices**: While one alternative would be to load the entire quiz (all questions) in a single HTTP request, this is **not preferred** for several reasons:
   - **Client-side Processing**: Bringing all questions in one request might seem efficient, but it can expose too much data at once. Processing quiz questions client-side opens the door to **security vulnerabilities**, as the user has access to the full set of questions (and potentially the answers) before the quiz even starts.
   - **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Even if the quiz content itself isn't classified as sensitive data, exposing too much at once can lead to unintended security risks. For example, users could manipulate data or game the system if they had access to all questions in advance.

### Leveraging WebSockets with Django Channels

In this project, we've used **Django Channels** to implement WebSockets for real-time communication between the server and the client. Here's how it works:

- **Live Connection**: When a user starts a quiz (e.g., **Quiz 1**), a WebSocket connection is established between the user's client and the server. This connection stays open for the entire duration of the quiz.
  
- **Efficient Data Delivery**: The server can then send **questions one at a time** (or in a batch) as the quiz progresses, without needing to close and reopen connections for each question. This means that the server doesn't need to handle multiple HTTP requests, reducing overhead and improving performance.

- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets allow the server to push **real-time updates** to the client, such as showing the next question, updating the timer, and even sending quiz results dynamically. This keeps the user experience smooth and interactive.

In summary, **WebSockets** are used to **maintain a persistent connection**, allowing the server to send quiz questions as needed and minimizing unnecessary requests, while also improving security by keeping sensitive data like quiz questions under server control.

By using **Django Channels**, we were able to easily implement WebSockets and handle real-time data transmission, ensuring a **smooth, interactive experience** for users participating in the quiz.
